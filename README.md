This project involved creating a paginated report for a hospital survey, using stored procedure as data source from MySQL database. The report included multiple pages with matrix visuals and incorporated parameters and conditional logic to control the display of certain matrices based on conditions.

**DESCRIPTION:**

In this project, I developed a detailed paginated report for a hospital survey, leveraging a stored procedure as the primary data source from a SQL Server database. The report was designed to provide comprehensive insights into survey results, structured across multiple pages with various visual elements.

**Key Features and Components:**

**1- Stored Procedure as Data Source:**

The report was powered by a stored procedure in the SQL Server database, which efficiently retrieved and processed the necessary data. The stored procedure included parameters that allowed for dynamic filtering and customization of the report based on specific criteria, such as survey date range or department.

**2- Multiple Pages and Matrix Visuals:**
The report was structured across multiple pages to accommodate different aspects of the survey results. Matrix visuals were prominently featured to present the data in a clear and organized manner, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of responses across different categories or groups.
The matrix visuals were designed to display data in rows and columns, making it easy to spot trends, patterns, and outliers in the survey responses.

**3- Conditional Logic:**
Conditional logic was applied within the report to control the visibility of certain matrices. This logic ensured that only relevant data was displayed, based on the parameters selected or specific conditions met. For example, if a particular department had no responses for a given question, the corresponding matrix would be hidden, streamlining the report and focusing on pertinent information.

**4- Parameters for Customization:**
The stored procedure's parameters allowed users to customize the report output, such as selecting specific departments, timeframes, or other survey criteria. This flexibility ensured that the report could be tailored to meet the diverse needs of different stakeholders within the hospital.

**5- Interactivity and Usability:**
The report's design prioritized usability and clarity, with interactive elements allowing users to easily navigate between pages and drill down into specific data points. The inclusion of parameters and conditional logic enhanced the report's interactivity, making it a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making.

**6- Insights and Benefits:**
By using a stored procedure, the report efficiently handled large datasets and complex queries, ensuring quick and accurate data retrieval. The multiple pages and matrix visuals provided a comprehensive view of the survey results, enabling hospital administrators and stakeholders to gain valuable insights into patient experiences and areas for improvement.
The conditional logic further refined the report, ensuring that users only saw the most relevant and actionable information, improving the overall effectiveness of the report.
